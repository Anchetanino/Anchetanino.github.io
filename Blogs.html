                    <p class="blogcontent">Yes, ladies, the rumors are true! Dresses and skirts are not just for summer, they can easily be styled in the fall as well. We love to style our dresses in the fall sometimes to switch up our classic jeans and a sweater looks. In
                        addition to looking stylish and trendy, dresses are also so easy and comfy to throw on for any occasion. We’ve seen countless Instagram posts of fashionistas rocking their dresses with boots, blazers, jackets, and more! Read on

                    <h6 class="blogheader">BY SHELCY JOSEPH</h6> <br>
                    <p class="blogcontent">Pearls have seen a resurgence in recent years, thanks in no small part to the prevalence of period dramas and the cottagecore movement. The TV shows and romanticized lifestyle trend have underscored the nostalgic mood that's taken
                        over fashion lately, especially as people emerge from the pandemic. More and more, pearls are being incorporated into day-to-day looks, rather than being strictly reserved for costumes or special occasions.</p>
                    <p class="blogcontent">Enter the pearlcore aesthetic, which refers to embellishing garments and accessories with pearls. Pinterest referenced it in its 2022 business report after noticing a spike in search traffic for pearl gowns, pearl wedding decorations,
                        and pearl-themed parties. Around the world, and particularly in Australia, people were also looking up pearl bracelets, pearl chokers, and pearl nails to enliven their looks. The report predicted what we're now currently seeing,
                        stating, "In 2022, people of all ages will embrace iridescent accents in their homes, in their jewelry boxes and even as nail art. Pearl-themed parties will be on the rise, too, as people opt for pearly gowns and wedding decor."</p>

                    <h6 class="blogheader">BY WING SZE TANG</h6> <br>
                    <p class="blogcontent">Spritz a fine mist of Chanel No. 5 and you won’t be reminded of a flower. Launched in 1921, the fragrance famously doesn’t evoke one. Rather, one might say it smells like abstract art — a composition beyond nature, a rebellion against
                        the demure (and, frankly, dull) lily of the valley-centric zeitgeist of its time. Instead, it produces an intense hit of powdery, soapy cleanness, which is the result of a lavish dose of aldehydes. To borrow Coco Chanel’s blunt
                        brief to her genius perfumer, Ernest Beaux: It smells like the scent of a woman and nothing else. However, it’s not a contradiction to say that the fragrance couldn’t be what it is without flowers — most crucially its signature
                        jasmine, and not from just anywhere. As for how Chanel No. 5 is made, the parfum, exactly as it exists today, is only possible because of what blossoms under the cover of night on one very specific, inconspicuous 20-hectare farm
                        — findable only if you know where to look — in the luminous village of Pégomas (population: around 8,000), in the arrondissement of Grasse, the world’s long-reigning perfume capital.</p>
                    <p class="blogcontent">“This jasmine has a specific scent that cannot be reproduced elsewhere,” explains Joseph Mul, patriarch of the family-owned estate that has exclusively supplied Chanel for decades. A fourth-generation flower farmer, he exudes the enthusiasm
                        you’d expect from someone who has spent his life nurturing delicate plants, encouraging us to lean in for a whiff even though the smooth, sweet notes are already perfuming the open air.</p>

                    <h6 class="blogheader">BY MARIE ROCKER</h6> <br>
                    <p class="blogcontent">The Spring weather is full of surprises and you never know what you’re going to get. One minute it’s rainy and cold and the next it’s full of sunshine. It’s confusing to us fashionistas! Tricky weather has not stopped us from our plans
                        before and they certainly won’t stop us now. No need to contemplate any longer about what to wear for the unexpected Spring weather because Fashion Style Guru has got you covered. Our savvy fashion-forward bloggers know exactly
                        how to solve this fashion crisis with a few tips and tricks. Read on for the tips!</p>
                    <p class="blogcontent">The key to ruling Spring with the latest yet comfortable fashion trends is layering. Whether it’s a cool or warm day, learning how to layer properly is essential for the Springtime. For a cold rainy day, layering up on sweaters and
                        jackets is the right idea. Grab a beanie and scarf too, it’s still not too late to rock them! Because the Spring weather is so unexpected, layering a short-sleeve shirt underneath a sweater, if possible, is life-saving. Be prepared
                        for anything. If it’s a warmer day, take advantage of it and break out some shorts and a t-shirt. While soaking up the sun feels great, it’s never a bad idea to bring along a sweater or jacket of some sort for extra warmth if the
                        weather takes a chilly turn.</p>
